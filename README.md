## Problem

Mikro-orm does not create FK and PK columns of type `MEDIUMINT`. Setting `columntType="MEDIUMINT` on property has no
effect on the generated schema.

[./generated-schemas/basic.sql](./generated-schemas/basic.sql) was generated by code in second commit. [(commit e0b3575)](https://github.com/Amarettini/mikro-orm-mediumint-missing-on-fk-and-pk-column/commit/e0b35758b5e37d5e6b091aa9589cadc2825dee27).

[./generated-schemas/with-mediumint.sql](./generated-schemas/basic.sql) was generated by code in fourth commit. [(commit d9b774d)](https://github.com/Amarettini/mikro-orm-mediumint-missing-on-fk-and-pk-column/commit/d9b774da876e3b73af59390c3d6c20a0b7788402)

Both files are equal, although `MEDIUMINT` was set as column type for both referencing (FK) and referenced (PK) columns.

If this is a limitation of the `@mikro-orm/mysql-driver` or `kenx.js` than this should be mentioned in the docs.
