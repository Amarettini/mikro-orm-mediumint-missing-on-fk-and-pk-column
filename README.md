## Problem

Mikro-orm does not create FK columns of type `MEDIUMINT`. Setting `columntType="MEDIUMINT` on property has no
affect on the generated schema.

./generated-schemas/basic.sql was generated by code in second commit (commit:e0b3575).

./generated-schemas/with-mediumint.sql was generated by code in fourth commit. (commit:d9b774d)

Both files are equal, although `MEDIUMINT` was set as column type both referencing and referenced column.

If this is a limitation of the `@mikro-orm/mysql-driver` or `kenx.js` than this should be mentioned in the docs.
