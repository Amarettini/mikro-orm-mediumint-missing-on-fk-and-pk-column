## Problem

Mikro-orm does not create FK columns of type `MEDIUMINT`. Setting `columntType="MEDIUMINT` on property has no
affect on the generated schema.

./generated-schemas/basic.sql was generated by code in first commit.

./generated-schemas/with-mediumint.sql was generated by code in third commit.

Both files are equal, although `MEDIUMINT` was set as column type both referencing and referenced column.

If this is a limitation of the `@mikro-orm/mysql-driver` or `kenx.js` than this should be mentioned in the docs.


## Commands History
```bash
# Creates new schema and dumps to file
npx mikro-orm schema:create --dump>generated-schemas/basic.sql


# Drops and creates new schema
npx mikro-orm schema:fresh --run


```
